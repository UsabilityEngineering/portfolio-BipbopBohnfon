# Gamified Hacking with the Flipper Zero

## So What is it, Anywho?
I have been playing around with the <a href="https://flipperzero.one/">Flipper Zero</a>, a portable multi-function hacking device disguised as a virtual pet, similar to a tamagotchi.

 The device is primarily used for capturing, saving, managing, and playing back various digital and analog signals, such as Sub-GHz key fobs, NFC cards, and RFID tags. 

 ## A Flippin' Problem
 The design of the device, on the surface, may seem like a recipe for issues with **consistency and standards**, as users, upon first seeing the device, bring their expectations from Gamepads and Game Controllers. There may be significant friction when first using the device as the only human interfaces are a D-Pad, a Confirm Button, and a Back Button, on account of the functions available are so complex and varied.

 To perfectly illustrate issues that arise out of this, we need only look at the process for naming a file:

 As with many tasks on the Flipper, *how* one would interact with the device is **discoverable**, but the process is absolutely not **efficient or satisfying**. The interface can often evoke the frustration of sending a text message of a flip phone, where it can take hundreds of key presses to write a short sentence, and it can lead users to use short, non-descriptive names. I have already encountered this issue, where I had an RX device that could process digital and analog signals, which I ended up naming DEV_raw_dig, DEV_raw_ana, DEV_enc_dig, and DEV_enc_ana. Dev is a stand-in for the name of the controlled device and raw/enc are used to denote whether the signal being sent is raw or a resconstruction of the encoded signal. Inputting the names alone took about *5 minutes...*

## But is it Worth it?
YES! Yes, absolutely. The features included in the Flipper, paired with the relatively low price, make it an excellent pen-testing tool, as well as a decent swiss-army knife that can be used to solve problems with electronic devices if you are desperate enough.
