# Gamified Hacking with the Flipper Zero

## So What is it, Anywho?
I have been playing around with the <a href="https://flipperzero.one/">Flipper Zero</a>, a portable multi-function hacking device disguised as a virtual pet, similar to a tamagotchi.

 The device is primarily used for capturing, saving, managing, and playing back various digital and analog signals, such as Sub-GHz key fobs, NFC cards, and RFID tags. 

 ## A Flippin' Problem
 The design of the device, on the surface, may seem like a recipe for issues with **consistency and standards**, as users, upon first seeing the device, bring their expectations from Gamepads and Game Controllers. There may be significant friction when first using the device as the only human interfaces are a D-Pad, a Confirm Button, and a Back Button, on account of the functions available are so complex and varied.

 To perfectly illustrate issues that arise out of this, we need only look at the process for naming a file:

 As with many tasks on the Flipper, *how* one would interact with the device is **discoverable**, but the process is absolutely not **efficient or satisfying**. The interface can often evoke the frustration of sending a text message of a flip phone, where it can take hundreds of key presses to write a short sentence, and it can lead users to use short, non-descriptive names. I have already encountered this issue, where I had an RX device that could process digital and analog signals, which I ended up naming DEV_raw_dig, DEV_raw_ana, DEV_enc_dig, and DEV_enc_ana. Dev is a stand-in for the name of the controlled device and raw/enc are used to denote whether the signal being sent is raw or a resconstruction of the encoded signal. Inputting the names alone took about *5 minutes...*

## But is it Worth it?
YES! Yes, absolutely. The features included in the Flipper, paired with the relatively low price, make it an excellent pen-testing tool, as well as a decent swiss-army knife that can be used to solve problems with electronic devices if you are desperate enough. 
 
    "By line" with your name and the date of the journal entry
    Image(s) or videos to help illustrate your narrative of the interaction. These should be real images/videos of the interaction that show the process. You may "recreate" the interaction if you wish and you can add markup or other editing if it makes it easier to communicate what is happening to the reader.
    A narrative that tells a story of a particular user experience you had with technology. It should include your goals, a description of the interaction, and the outcome. You should assess the user experience in terms of a new concepts you learned from class (e.g. feedback, affordance, mental model, etc.) but only highlight the most relevant concepts that were not already in your vernacular. When any of the terms are used in your narrative, you should highlight them in bold (surround word with double asterisks in markdown e.g. **word**) and provide a description in your own words. The assessment of the interaction can be nuanced, acknowledging any strengths and weaknesses. Suggestions for how the weaknesses can be addressed will make for a particularly strong journal entry.

    Keep in mind that the journal entry is a narrative of a specific interaction, not a general product review.

    The writing style should resemble a relatively informal style of blogs. The entries should also communicate to a broad audience, who do not necessarily know UX terminology, so make sure to describe things in a way most people can understand.
